Description of the user and the problem you are solving for them
Example 1: As a developer, it is important to understand the concepts of multi-page rendering, complex data structures, form submission, tables, and flex-box CSS styling.
Example 2: The user for my application is a developer who wishes to pin repositories, create packages, and display projects for retention and collaboration.
List of features: This project includes 4 different pages (overview, repos, projects, and packages). The user can utillize a form to pin repositories, create a new project, and submit packages. They can also use the navigation bar to move in-between pages with ease.
